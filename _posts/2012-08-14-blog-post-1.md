This is a blog post about the data preprocessing step of my AI studio project.


Data Preparation
======
Our input would be images, and the dataset we start with is challenge 1 sample dataset from Smart Doc 2015. This dataset is video clips containing documents. Thus, our first step is to extract frames from the videos and then use the frames as our data. To build a model that can classify documents and non-documents, then we want to add images that do not contain documents by cropping the frames.
After classification, we would do bounding boxes.
