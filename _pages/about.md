## About me
Hi! I'm Jiaxin. I'm a 4th-year undergrad double-majoring in Statistics & Data Science and Linguistics & Computer Science at UCLA, where I am a member of the [Trustworthy AI Lab](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~guangcheng/) and had the opportunity to work with Professor [Guang Cheng](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~guangcheng/2.html) and Professor [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/). 

I am interested in NLP (Healthcare, Language Models) and synthetic data generation & evaluation. You can check my [Resume]()/[CV]() here. Outside of my professional pursuits, I am an avid runner, food enthusiast, and traveller.
